     - Explain how it builds on previous work
  
  2. **Story Breakdown**
  
     **Critical Story Requirements:**
     - **Vertical slices** - Each story delivers complete, testable functionality

     - **No forward dependencies** - No story depends on work from a later story/epic
     - **AI-agent sized** - Completable in single focused session (2-4 hours)
     - **Value-focused** - Minimize pure enabler stories; integrate technical work into value delivery

  ## Overview
  
  This document provides the detailed epic breakdown for {{project_name}}, expanding on the high-level epic list in the [PRD](./PRD.md).
  
  Each epic includes:
  
  - Expanded goal and value proposition
  - Complete story breakdown with user stories
  - Acceptance criteria for each story
  - Story sequencing and dependencies
  
  **Epic Sequencing Principles:**
  
  - Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure and initial functionality
  - Subsequent epics build progressively, each delivering significant end-to-end value
  - Stories within epics are vertically sliced and sequentially ordered
  - No forward dependencies - each story builds only on previous work

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. [Specific testable criterion]
  2. [Another specific criterion]
  3. [etc.]
  
  **Prerequisites:** [Dependencies on previous stories, if any]
  ```
  
  **Story Requirements:**
  
  - **Vertical slices** - Complete, testable functionality delivery
  - **Sequential ordering** - Logical progression within epic
  - **No forward dependencies** - Only depend on previous work
  - **AI-agent sized** - Completable in 2-4 hour focused session
  - **Value-focused** - Integrate technical enablers into value-delivering stories

  **Current Step:** {{current_step}}
  **Next Step:** {{next_step}}
  
  **Instructions:**
  
  - This plan was created during initial workflow-status setup
  - Status values: Planned, Optional, Conditional, In Progress, Complete
  - Current/Next steps update as you progress through the workflow
  - Use this as your roadmap to know what comes after each phase
  
  ### Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)
  
  **Story Tracking:** {{story_tracking_mode}}
  
  {{#if in_phase_4}}
  
  #### BACKLOG (Not Yet Drafted)
  
  **Ordered story sequence - populated at Phase 4 start:**
  
  | Epic | Story | ID  | Title | File |
  | ---- | ----- | --- | ----- | ---- |
  
  {{#backlog_stories}}
  | {{epic_num}} | {{story_num}} | {{story_id}} | {{story_title}} | {{story_file}} |
  {{/backlog_stories}}
  
  **Total in backlog:** {{backlog_count}} stories
  
  **Instructions:**
  
  - Stories move from BACKLOG → TODO when previous story is complete
  - SM agent uses story information from this table to draft new stories
  - Story order is sequential (Epic 1 stories first, then Epic 2, etc.)
  
  #### TODO (Needs Drafting)
  
  - **Story ID:** {{todo_story_id}}
  - **Story Title:** {{todo_story_title}}
  - **Story File:** `{{todo_story_file}}`
  - **Status:** Not created OR Draft (needs review)
  - **Action:** SM should run `create-story` workflow to draft this story
  
  **Instructions:**
  
  - Only ONE story in TODO at a time
  - Story stays in TODO until user marks it "ready for development"
  - SM reads this section to know which story to draft next
  - After SM creates/updates story, user reviews and approves via `story-ready` workflow
  
  #### IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)
  
  - **Story ID:** {{current_story_id}}
  - **Story Title:** {{current_story_title}}
  - **Story File:** `{{current_story_file}}`
  - **Story Status:** Ready | In Review
  - **Context File:** `{{current_story_context_file}}`
  - **Action:** DEV should run `dev-story` workflow to implement this story
  
  **Instructions:**
  
  - Only ONE story in IN PROGRESS at a time
  - Story stays here until user marks it "approved" (DoD complete)
  - DEV reads this section to know which story to implement
  - After DEV completes story, user reviews and runs `story-approved` workflow
  
  #### DONE (Completed Stories)
  
  | Story ID | File | Completed Date | Points |
  | -------- | ---- | -------------- | ------ |
  
  {{#done_stories}}
  | {{story_id}} | {{story_file}} | {{completed_date}} | {{story_points}} |
  {{/done_stories}}
  
  **Total completed:** {{done_count}} stories
  **Total points completed:** {{done_points}} points
  
  **Instructions:**
  
  - Stories move here when user runs `story-approved` workflow (DEV agent)
  - Immutable record of completed work
  - Used for velocity tracking and progress reporting
  
  #### Epic/Story Summary
  
  **Total Epics:** {{total_epics}}
  **Total Stories:** {{total_stories}}
  **Stories in Backlog:** {{backlog_count}}
  **Stories in TODO:** {{todo_count}} (should always be 0 or 1)
  **Stories in IN PROGRESS:** {{in_progress_count}} (should always be 0 or 1)
  **Stories DONE:** {{done_count}}
  
  **Epic Breakdown:**
  {{#epics}}
  
  - Epic {{epic_number}}: {{epic_title}} ({{epic_done_stories}}/{{epic_total_stories}} stories complete)
    {{/epics}}
  
  #### State Transition Logic
  
  **Story Lifecycle:**
  
  ```
  BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE
  ```
  
  **Transition Rules:**
  
  1. **BACKLOG → TODO**: Automatically when previous story moves TODO → IN PROGRESS
  2. **TODO → IN PROGRESS**: User runs SM agent `story-ready` workflow after reviewing drafted story
  3. **IN PROGRESS → DONE**: User runs DEV agent `story-approved` workflow after DoD complete
  
  **Important:**
  
  - SM agent NEVER searches for "next story" - always reads TODO section
  - DEV agent NEVER searches for "current story" - always reads IN PROGRESS section
  - Both agents update this status file after their workflows complete

  - [ ] **Generate implementation task**
    - Command: `workflow task-generation`
    - Uses: tech-spec.md
  
  <check if="change is backend/API only">
  
  **Recommended Next Steps:**
  
  - [ ] **Create test plan** for the change
    - Unit tests for the specific change
    - Integration test if affects other components
  
  - [ ] **Generate implementation task**
    - Command: `workflow task-generation`
    - Uses: tech-spec.md
  
  <ask>Level 0 planning complete! Next action:

  **Story Point Estimation:**
  - 1 point = < 1 day (2-4 hours)
  - 2 points = 1-2 days
  - 3 points = 2-3 days
  - 5 points = 3-5 days (if this high, question if truly Level 0)
  
  **Story Title Best Practices:**
  
  - Use active, user-focused language
  - Describe WHAT is delivered, not HOW
  - Good: "Icon Migration to Internal CDN"
  - Bad: "Run curl commands to download PNGs"
  
  **Story Description Format:**
  
  - As a [role] (developer, user, admin, etc.)
  - I want [capability/change]
  - So that [benefit/value]
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  
  - Extract from tech-spec "Testing Approach" section
  - Must be specific, measurable, and testable
  - Include performance criteria if specified
  
  **Tasks/Subtasks:**
  
  - Map directly to tech-spec "Implementation Guide" tasks
  - Use checkboxes for tracking
  - Reference AC numbers: (AC: #1), (AC: #2)
  - Include explicit testing subtasks
  
  **Dev Notes:**
  
  - Extract technical constraints from tech-spec
  - Include file paths from "Source Tree Structure"
  - Reference architecture patterns if applicable
  - Cite tech-spec sections for implementation details

  <workflow>
  
  <critical>This generates epic and user stories for Level 1 projects after tech-spec completion</critical>
  <critical>This is a lightweight story breakdown - not a full PRD</critical>
  <critical>Level 1 = coherent feature, 1-10 stories (prefer 2-3), 1 epic</critical>
  <critical>This workflow runs AFTER tech-spec.md has been completed</critical>
  <critical>Story format MUST match create-story template for compatibility with story-context and dev-story workflows</critical>
  
  <step n="1" goal="Load tech spec and extract implementation tasks">
  
  <action>Read the completed tech-spec.md file from {output_folder}/tech-spec.md</action>
  <action>Load bmm-workflow-status.md from {output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.md</action>
  <action>Extract dev_story_location from config (where stories are stored)</action>
  <action>Identify all implementation tasks from the "Implementation Guide" section</action>
  <action>Identify the overall feature goal from "Technical Approach" section</action>
  <action>Extract time estimates for each implementation phase</action>
  <action>Identify any dependencies between implementation tasks</action>
  
  </step>
  
  <step n="2" goal="Create single epic">
  
  <action>Create 1 epic that represents the entire feature</action>
  <action>Epic title should be user-facing value statement</action>
  <action>Epic goal should describe why this matters to users</action>
  
  <guidelines>
  **Epic Best Practices:**
  - Title format: User-focused outcome (not implementation detail)
  - Good: "JS Library Icon Reliability"
  - Bad: "Update recommendedLibraries.ts file"
  - Scope: Clearly define what's included/excluded
  - Success criteria: Measurable outcomes that define "done"
  </guidelines>
  
  <example>
  **Epic:** JS Library Icon Reliability
  
  **Goal:** Eliminate external dependencies for JS library icons to ensure consistent, reliable display and improve application performance.
  
  **Scope:** Migrate all 14 recommended JS library icons from third-party CDN URLs (GitHub, jsDelivr) to internal static asset hosting.
  
  **Success Criteria:**
  
  - All library icons load from internal paths
  - Zero external requests for library icons
  - Icons load 50-200ms faster than baseline
  - No broken icons in production
    </example>
  
  <action>Derive epic slug from epic title (kebab-case, 2-3 words max)</action>
  <example>
  
  - "JS Library Icon Reliability" → "icon-reliability"
  - "OAuth Integration" → "oauth-integration"
  - "Admin Dashboard" → "admin-dashboard"
    </example>
  
  <action>Initialize epics.md summary document using epics_template</action>
  
  <template-output file="{output_folder}/epics.md">epic_title</template-output>
  <template-output file="{output_folder}/epics.md">epic_slug</template-output>
  <template-output file="{output_folder}/epics.md">epic_goal</template-output>
  <template-output file="{output_folder}/epics.md">epic_scope</template-output>
  <template-output file="{output_folder}/epics.md">epic_success_criteria</template-output>
  <template-output file="{output_folder}/epics.md">epic_dependencies</template-output>
  
  </step>
  
  <step n="3" goal="Determine optimal story count">
  
  <critical>Level 1 should have 2-3 stories maximum - prefer longer stories over more stories</critical>
  
  <action>Analyze tech spec implementation tasks and time estimates</action>
  <action>Group related tasks into logical story boundaries</action>
  
  <guidelines>
  **Story Count Decision Matrix:**
  
  **2 Stories (preferred for most Level 1):**
  
  - Use when: Feature has clear build/verify split
  - Example: Story 1 = Build feature, Story 2 = Test and deploy
  - Typical points: 3-5 points per story
  
  **3 Stories (only if necessary):**
  
  - Use when: Feature has distinct setup, build, verify phases
  - Example: Story 1 = Setup, Story 2 = Core implementation, Story 3 = Integration and testing
  - Typical points: 2-3 points per story
  
  **Never exceed 3 stories for Level 1:**
  
  - If more needed, consider if project should be Level 2
  - Better to have longer stories (5 points) than more stories (5x 1-point stories)
    </guidelines>
  
  <action>Determine story_count = 2 or 3 based on tech spec complexity</action>
  
  </step>
  
  <step n="4" goal="Generate user stories from tech spec tasks">
  
  <action>For each story (2-3 total), generate separate story file</action>
  <action>Story filename format: "story-{epic_slug}-{n}.md" where n = 1, 2, or 3</action>
  
  <guidelines>
  **Story Generation Guidelines:**
  - Each story = multiple implementation tasks from tech spec
  - Story title format: User-focused deliverable (not implementation steps)
  - Include technical acceptance criteria from tech spec tasks
  - Link back to tech spec sections for implementation details
  
  **Story Point Estimation:**
  
  - 1 point = < 1 day (2-4 hours)
  - 2 points = 1-2 days
  - 3 points = 2-3 days
  - 5 points = 3-5 days
  
  **Level 1 Typical Totals:**
  
  - Total story points: 5-10 points
  - 2 stories: 3-5 points each
  - 3 stories: 2-3 points each
  - If total > 15 points, consider if this should be Level 2
  
  **Story Structure (MUST match create-story format):**
  
  - Status: Draft
  - Story: As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]
  - Acceptance Criteria: Numbered list from tech spec
  - Tasks / Subtasks: Checkboxes mapped to tech spec tasks (AC: #n references)
  - Dev Notes: Technical summary, project structure notes, references
  - Dev Agent Record: Empty sections for context workflow to populate
    </guidelines>
  
  <for-each story="1 to story_count">
    <action>Set story_path_{n} = "{dev_story_location}/story-{epic_slug}-{n}.md"</action>
    <action>Create story file from user_story_template with the following content:</action>
  
    <template-output file="{story_path_{n}}">
      - story_title: User-focused deliverable title
      - role: User role (e.g., developer, user, admin)
      - capability: What they want to do
      - benefit: Why it matters
      - acceptance_criteria: Specific, measurable criteria from tech spec
      - tasks_subtasks: Implementation tasks with AC references
      - technical_summary: High-level approach, key decisions
      - files_to_modify: List of files that will change
      - test_locations: Where tests will be added
      - story_points: Estimated effort (1/2/3/5)
      - time_estimate: Days/hours estimate
      - architecture_references: Links to tech-spec.md sections
