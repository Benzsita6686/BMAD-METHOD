  This context guide provides project-specific considerations for brainstorming sessions focused on software and product development.
  
  ## Session Focus Areas
  
  When brainstorming for projects, consider exploring:
  
  - **User Problems and Pain Points** - What challenges do users face?
  - **Feature Ideas and Capabilities** - What could the product do?
  - **Technical Approaches** - How might we build it?
  - **User Experience** - How will users interact with it?
  - **Business Model and Value** - How does it create value?
  - **Market Differentiation** - What makes it unique?
  - **Technical Risks and Challenges** - What could go wrong?
  - **Success Metrics** - How will we measure success?
  
  ## Integration with Project Workflow
  
  Brainstorming sessions typically feed into:
  
  - **Product Briefs** - Initial product vision and strategy
  - **PRDs** - Detailed requirements documents
  - **Technical Specifications** - Architecture and implementation plans
  - **Research Activities** - Areas requiring further investigation
