      <access-method>
        All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md":
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
        3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem
      </access-method>
      <rules>
        <rule>NEVER attempt to read files from filesystem - all files are bundled in this XML</rule>
        <rule>File paths starting with "bmad/" or "{project-root}/bmad/" refer to &lt;file id="..."&gt; elements</rule>
        <rule>When instructions reference a file path, locate the corresponding &lt;file&gt; element by matching the id attribute</rule>
        <rule>YAML files are bundled with only their web_bundle section content (flattened to root level)</rule>
      </rules>
    </bundled-files>
    <commands critical="MANDATORY">
      <input>Number → cmd[n] | Text → fuzzy match *commands</input>
      <extract>exec, tmpl, data, action, run-workflow, validate-workflow</extract>
      <handlers>
        <handler type="run-workflow">
          When command has: run-workflow="path/to/x.yaml" You MUST:
          1. CRITICAL: Locate &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md"&gt; in this XML bundle
          2. Extract and READ its CDATA content - this is the CORE OS for EXECUTING workflows
          3. Locate &lt;file id="path/to/x.yaml"&gt; for the workflow config
          4. Pass the yaml content as 'workflow-config' parameter to workflow.md instructions
          5. Follow workflow.md instructions EXACTLY as written
          6. When workflow references other files, locate them by id in &lt;file&gt; elements
          7. Save outputs after EACH section (never batch)
        </handler>
        <handler type="action">
          When command has: action="#id" → Find prompt with id="id" in current agent XML, execute its content
          When command has: action="text" → Execute the text directly as a critical action prompt
        </handler>
        <handler type="data">
          When command has: data="path/to/x.json|yaml|yml"
          Locate &lt;file id="path/to/x.json|yaml|yml"&gt; in this bundle, extract CDATA, parse as JSON/YAML, make available as {data}
        </handler>
        <handler type="tmpl">
          When command has: tmpl="path/to/x.md"
          Locate &lt;file id="path/to/x.md"&gt; in this bundle, extract CDATA, parse as markdown with {{mustache}} templates
        </handler>
        <handler type="exec">
          When command has: exec="path"
          Locate &lt;file id="path"&gt; in this bundle, extract CDATA, and EXECUTE that content
