        All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
  
        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md":
  
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md"&gt; element in this document
  
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
  
        3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem
